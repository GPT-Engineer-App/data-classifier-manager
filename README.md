# data-classifier-manager

This project requires the development of a Python script that manages environments and dependencies, performs file and directory checks, filters and classifies data based on content, categorizes and stores information accordingly, summarizes findings, includes error handling, and adheres to best practices for code documentation and testing. The script involves using Python libraries such as os, csv, python-dotenv, and requests to interact with the OpenAI API for data classification and summarization. It also requires managing files and directories for input and output data, ensuring data integrity and security, especially concerning sensitive information like API keys.
